# Real mode:
#   - QEMU_BIN: ~/qemu-patched/bin/qemu-system-i386 (has addresses in segment:offset)
#   - .gdbinit (start): set architecture i8086

# Protected mode:
#   - QEMU_BIN: qemu-system-i386 (what addressing would it have? 32-bit instruction set)
#   - .gdbinit (start): set architecture i386

# Long mode:
# Protected mode:
#   - QEMU_BIN: qemu-system-x86_64 (what addressing would it have? 64-bit instruction set)
#   - .gdbinit (start): set architecture i386:x86-64
# The moment you run "QEMU_BIN=qemu-system-x86_64" you have to "set architecture i386:x86-64" to debug with GDB
# You can't look at protected mode (32 bits) on "QEMU_BIN=qemu-system-x86_64" with "set architecture i386"
